=c

FromDPDKDevice(PORT [, QUEUE, N_QUEUES, I<keywords> PROMISC, BURST, NDESC])

=s netdevices

reads packets from network device using Intel's DPDK (user-level)

=d

Reads packets from the network device with DPDK port identifier PORT.

On the contrary to FromDevice.u which acts as a sniffer by default, packets
received by devices put in DPDK mode will NOT be received by the kernel, and
will thus be processed only once.

Arguments:

=over 8

=item PORT

Integer or PCI address.  Port identifier of the device, or a PCI address in the
format fffff:ff:ff.f

=item QUEUE

Integer.  A specific hardware queue to use. Default is 0.

=item N_QUEUES

Integer.  Number of hardware queues to use. -1 or default is to use as many queues as threads assigned to this element.

=item PROMISC

Boolean.  FromDPDKDevice puts the device in promiscuous mode if PROMISC is
true. The default is false.

=item BURST

Integer.  Maximal number of packets that will be processed before rescheduling.
The default is 32.

=item MAXTHREADS

Maximal number of threads that this element will take to read packets from
the input queue. If unset (or negative) all threads not pinned with a
ThreadScheduler element will be shared among FromDPDKDevice elements and
other input elements supporting multiqueue (extending QueueDevice)

=item THREADOFFSET

Specify which Click thread will handle this element. If multiple
j threads are used, threads with id THREADOFFSET+j will be used. Default is
to share the threads available on the device's NUMA node equally.

=item NDESC

Integer.  Number of descriptors per ring. The default is 256.

=back

This element is only available at user level, when compiled with DPDK
support.

=e

  FromDPDKDevice(3, QUEUE 1) -> ...

=h count read-only

Returns the number of packets read by the device.

=h reset_count write-only

Resets "count" to zero.
